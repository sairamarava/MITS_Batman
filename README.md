# MITS_AIBIRDS

MITS_AIBIRDS is a repository for SIMS (Similarity Score)Python package that provides easy-to-use functions for calculating various similarity scores, including Jaccard, Overlap, and Hamming Distance. These scores can be useful in a wide range of applications, such as text analysis, bioinformatics, and data science.

## Features

- **Jaccard Similarity**: Measures the similarity between two sets by dividing the size of the intersection by the size of the union.
- **Overlap Similarity**: Calculates the overlap between two sets by dividing the size of the intersection by the size of the smaller set.
- **Hamming Distance**: Measures the number of positions at which the corresponding elements are different between two strings of equal length.

## Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```bash
